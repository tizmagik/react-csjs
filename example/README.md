# React CSJS Example

This is a fully working React app (using [kyt](https://github.com/NYTimes/kyt)) that shows some example `react-csjs` usage.

You can use this as a reference or as a place to test out changes to `react-csjs` for local development before submitting a PR. The `react-csjs` module referenced in this example repo is aliased to `../src`, so any changes made there will be reflected.

## Installation

From within the `/example` directory:

```
npm i
```

Or, if using [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn):

```
yarn
```

## Running

```
npm run dev
```

Then the app will be running on http://localhost:3000
