# React CSJS Example

This is a fully working React app (using [kyt](https://github.com/NYTimes/kyt)) that shows some example `react-csjs` usage.

You can use this as a reference or as a place to test out changes to `react-csjs` for local development before submitting a PR. The `react-csjs` module referenced in this example repo is aliased to `../src`, so any changes made there will be reflected.

## Example usage

The various [components](./src/components) in this app show example usage patterns in react-csjs. The patterns shown in [`<Code />`](./src/components/Code/index.js) and [`<Header />`](./src/components/Header/index.js) components are recommended.

## Installation

From within the `/example` directory:

```
npm i
```

Or, if using [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn):

```
yarn
```

## Running

```
npm run dev
```

Then the app will be running on http://localhost:3000
